## Features

### Patients

Doctor Appointments is a platform where patients can easily search for doctors and book appointments fast without having to go trough the touble of signing up or creating an account. Just open the app, search for doctors, check free appointments and book them. Leave your email for the doctor to respond to your appointment booking and that's it. After the appointment you'll have a review possibility to share your experience with future patients.

### Doctors

Doctors have to sign up for an account where they can fill in their data. Once the account is created, you'll have access to your personal dashboard to view and manage all your past and future appointments. A email notification is send when patients request bookings and there is the option to accept or decline them.

### Email notice

All mails are send to a mail trap inbox, so if you sign up you will not actually receive emails. Also the app is deployed with a free plan and will spin down with inactivity. This means cron jobs will likely not run. Anyways, it works.
